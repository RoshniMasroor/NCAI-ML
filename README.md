ANSWER 01:
Facebook  uses  Machine Learning  algorithms showing  Ads  related to the topics we recently searched for. It identifies the faces of people in photos that  we  post  and  asks  us if  we want to tag them. It gives us the option “People  you may know”  by sorting  out people from  our contact list. It shows us the post of people  to whom we talk the most,like their posts or search them mostly.

ANSWER 02:
Deep learning is the  subset of  Machine learning that works on neural networks. By using deep learning algorithms we may be able  to train our models to take decisions on their own, to show their feelings/emotion , in other words behave exactly like a human. These days  deep learning  is being used in the field of medical sciences to track or to figure out cancer/ tumour cells etc and that’s how deep learning can do wonders!

ANSWER 03:
My dream AI Project is an AI Software that can code  other AI software automatically based on the problem. According to my point of  view, if  I give a problem to that AI software , it’ll  try itself  to solve the problem by designing a code itself. I came up with this idea since I’ve  heard about an AI that has written a movie .
